# <h3>SolShow </h3>
<h4>E2E (Exhibit To Earn) </h4> 
Introducing a new utility for NFTs -  SolShow introduces a new NFT utility within SolShow, allowing NFTs to be exploited to their full capacity. <br>
The user may create their own gallery by connecting their wallet to SolShow. They can charge fees to spectators, so that might be a source of revenue.  <br>
As a result, the <i>"Exhibit2Earn"</i> concept simplifies the answer to inactive NFTs with restricted use.  <br>

Exhibition Metaverse 
<u>SolShow </u> is creating a exhibition metaverse where collector's and creator's NFTs may be exhibited, link your wallet, create your gallery,  <br>
present your tales, and choose the price to watch and exhibit in order to bring more utility to NFTs.  <br>
The price denotes the sol/eth used to display these NFTs, allowing creators to charge a specific amount. This fee, in turn,  <br>
generates revenue as viewers pay to view the gallery.  <br>
As a result, this method of profiting from showcasing is known as <i>"Exhibit to Earn"</i> or <i>"E2E"</i>, which is pioneered by SolShow.

<h4> Why Exhibit ? </h4>
The world of NFT art is a relatively new experience for everyone,  there are so many undiscovered avenues with the blockchain technology, <br>
especially when it comes to exhibiting your NFTs. <br>
I just wanna cite an example here. Imagine you buy an art from a famous artist but you just dump it in your store room, it doesn't hold any value does it? <br>
But when you hang the same art on the wall of your living room and tell the story behind that art then it holds the value it deserves. <br>
It’s similar with your NFT too, just being in your wallet, its true potential can’t be utilized so here we have introduced a utility where you can connect your wallet, create your gallery, present your tales, and set a price to exhibit and watch in order to bring more utility to NFTs.
